        For this assignment, I used both the Claude and GPT-4o AI models to render data from external API endpoints onto new pages of my 11ty site. Each proved to be highly effective in helping me build and debug the necessary logic.
        <br><br>
        Claude wrote perfect code to fetch and display external data. When I asked for a method to render the API content, Claude recommended using asynchronous JavaScript functions, which worked pretty well. The responses were clear and relevant to my tech stack, and they helped me implement functionality without unnecessary complexity.

        One of the aspects of using Claude that I should definitely talk about was how it handled the CSSâ€”its styling suggestions were cleaner and more elegant than those from GPT-4o. However, Claude occasionally took creative liberties and added features on its own, leading to CSS that wasn't fully coherent with the rest of the project's design language. While this showcased its generative capabilities, it would also require me to manually refactor the styles to align them with my overall layout and theme. I suppose giving it an example of the CSS used in the index pages would have led to a better prompt.

        On the other hand, GPT-4o performed just as well as Claude in terms of fetching and rendering API data in my 11ty site. It provided accurate, concise logic for retrieving data and integrating it cleanly into the templating system. Where GPT-4o stood out was in its CSS suggestions. While not as flashy or stylized as Claude's, its CSS was far more consistent with the rest of my site's existing design language. It didn't introduce unexpected new features or UI elements, and the structure it produced was easier to integrate without modification. This made GPT-4o slightly more dependable for maintaining design coherence throughout the project.
